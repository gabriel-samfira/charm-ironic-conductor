    Set Temp-Url-Key in the service object storage account. This enables Ironic
    to use the "direct" deploy method. In order for this to work, both Glance
    and Ironic must use the same tenant in their respective configs.

    This action must be performed on the ironic-conductor leader, after the
    deployment is complete. Glance must either use Swift/RadosGW as a storage
    backend, or multi-backend must be enabled in Glance with Swift as one of
    the supported stores.

    A relation can be created between Glance and RadosGW, which will enable
    RadosGW to act as a backend for Glance.
